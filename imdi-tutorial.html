        </div>

        <div class="content">
		
            <p>
                In the following tutorial, you will learn how to use CMDI Maker to generate IMDI metadata.<br>
				<br>
				IMPORTANT: CMDI Maker saves all the data you input in a local browser database on your machine. You can close 
				the website anytime without losing data. When recalling the app, you can pick up where you left off.<br>
				Your data is NOT uploaded to a server nor synced between brosers!
            </p>	

			<p>
				In order that CMDI Maker works correctly, it is necessary that your browser allows websites to store APPCACHE and DOM Storage
				data on your device. This is enabled by default.
			</p>
	
			<h2 class="content-subhead" id="start">1. Start</h2>
            <p>
                Start the app by going to <a href="http://cmdi-maker.uni-koeln.de">http://cmdi-maker.uni-koeln.de</a>.
            </p>
			<div class="pure-u-1-1">
				<img class="content-img" src="img/imdi-tutorial/0.png">
			</div>
            <p>
                You will see the start page where you can choose your profile, i. e. the workflow you want to use to generate 
				metadata in the wanted XML format.<br>
				In the upper right corner, you can also change the language of the application.<br>
				After you have chosen your desired language and profile, click on "get started".
            </p>
			

			
			<h2 class="content-subhead" id="corpus_information">2. Corpus Information</h2>
            <p>
                In the workflow to generate IMDI files, the first thing to do is giving information about the corpus you want to create.<br>
				You can now begin with typing information into the input fields of the "Corpus" section.<br>
				When hovering with the cursor over an input field, a short description of the field will appear. This is intended for
				rendering assistance to the user. When you do not know straight what the field is for, this description may be of help.
				
            </p>
			<div class="pure-u-1-1">
				<img class="content-img" src="img/imdi-tutorial/1.png">
			</div>
            <p>
                After that, you can set global content languages for the whole corpus. When you type in a language name and click on search, a
				new view with search results will appear.
            </p>
			<div class="pure-u-1-1">
				<img class="content-img" src="img/imdi-tutorial/2.png">
			</div>
            <p>
                If the right language is present, you can add it to the corpus by clicking on it.<br>
				Alternatively, you can add languages by typing in the ISO639-3 code of the language, assuming that you know the right code.
				Delete languages by clicking on the "X" symbol of the specific language.<br>
				When finished, click on the next item in the workflow view, which is "Resources".
            </p>

 			<h2 class="content-subhead" id="resource_files">3. Resource Files</h2>
			<div class="pure-u-1-1">
				<img class="content-img" src="img/imdi-tutorial/4.png">
			</div>
            <p>
                In the "Resources" view, you can choose resource files to be added to the corpus. Adding resources means, that CMDI Maker reads
				their filenames and filesizes and displays file objects that can be added to sessions later on.<br>
				There are two ways of importing resource files:<br>
				1. Drag files from your file system browser onto the hot area.<br>
				2. Click on "Choose files..." to open a file dialog and select your files there.
            </p>
			<div class="pure-u-1-1">
				<img class="content-img" src="img/imdi-tutorial/5.png">
			</div>
            <p>
                There are several types of files:
				
				<li>Written Resources like XML, EAF, TXT, ... files (green)</li>
				<li>Media Files like WAV, MP4, MP3 (orange)</li>
				<li>Invalid files (red)</li><br>
				
				Some file objects contain a warning. This is to inform you that these files are maybe not accepted by the LAMUS file uploader later on.
				Nonetheless, you can add all kinds of files (even invalid ones) to a session.
				It is possible to remove single files, to clear the whole file list and to sort files alphabetically. It is also possible to create one
				session per file. Before that you must choose which files of the list shall be added. There are several options:<br>
				<br>
				<li>Selected files (Files can be selected by clicking on them)</li>
				<li>EAF files</li>
				<li>WAV files</li>
				<li>MPG files</li>
				<li>MP4 files</li><br>
				
				When an EAF file is added to a session and the session has not been named yet, it gets named automatically after the EAF file name.<br>
				When adding a file to a session, CMDI Maker also checks for files that start with the same string as the one to be added initially.<br>
				<br>
				Example:<br>
				There are several resources avaliable:<br>
				x001.eaf<br>
				x001.wav<br>
				x001_1.png<br>
				y002.wav<br>
				z003.eaf<br>
				<br>
				In the files menu, "EAF" is selected. In this case, two sessions will be generated:<br>
				Session 1 will contain "x001.eaf", "x001.wav" and "x001_1.png". Session 2 will contain "z003.eaf".
				
				
            </p>
			
			
			
			<h2 class="content-subhead" id="actors">4. Actors</h2>
			<p>
                Click on "Actors" to go to the next view.<br>
				Add an actor by clicking on "New Actor". A new form will appear where you can fill in all information about one actor.
				If not sure what a field is about, a description will appear when hovering with the cursor over some fields. You can add actor languages
				the same way you added global content languages before. Here you can also choose if a language is the mother tongue and/or primary language
				of the actor.
            </p>
			<div class="pure-u-1-1">
				<img class="content-img" src="img/imdi-tutorial/6.png">
			</div>
			<p>
                It is possible to delete actors, sort actors alphabetically and to duplicate actors.
            </p>
			
			
			
			<h2 class="content-subhead" id="sessions">5. Sessions</h2>
			<p>
                In the next view, sessions can be created and edited. It is possible to add single actors and resource files to a session.
				If you have created several sessions that share the same metadata, you do not have to manually type in the same metadata in every
				session. The function "Copy Session 1 metadata to all sessions" will take care of that. You can select the following metadata groups 
				to be copied:
				<li>Date</li>
				<li>Location</li>
				<li>Project</li>
				<li>Content</li>
				<li>Actors</li>
            </p>
			<div class="pure-u-1-1">
				<img class="content-img" src="img/imdi-tutorial/7.png">
			</div>
			<p>
                It is also possible to expand or collapse sessions, delete sessions and to sort them by name.<br>
				Note that every session must have a name as well as a project name. Unnamed sessions are not allowed. Session names must contain
				only valid characters, these are [A-Z],[a-z],[0-9],"_".
            </p>
			
			
			
			<h2 class="content-subhead" id="xml_output">6. XML Output</h2>
			<p>
                Congratulations! You mastered all steps to create IMDI metadata. When clicking on the last workflow item "XML output", you can
				marvel at your newly created XML. For the corpus and every session there is one XML file.
            </p>
			<div class="pure-u-1-1">
				<img class="content-img" src="img/imdi-tutorial/10.png">
			</div>
			<p>
                It is possible to download single XML files as well as download them all at once or compress all to a ZIP archive.
            </p>			


			
			<h2 class="content-subhead" id="settings">Settings</h2>
			<p>
                There are several settings that can be adjusted. Go to the settings view by clicking on the hamburger menu icon in the upper
				right corner and then on "Settings".
            </p>
			<div class="pure-u-1-1">
				<img class="content-img" src="img/imdi-tutorial/11.png">
			</div>
			<h3>Settings</h3>
				<h4>Output Format</h4>
				<p>Select in which output format the metadata shall be created: IMDI or CMDI with IMDI profile.</p>

				<h4>Global Language Of Metadata</h4>
				<p>The language of the metadata you have entered.</p>
				
				<h4>CMDI Metadata Creator</h4>
				<p>The CMDI metadata format requires the name of a metadata creator. This is probably you.</p>

				<h4>Calculate Actor's Age</h4>
				<p>When this feature is activated, CMDI Maker checks if the age of an actor (if it has not been specified already)
				can be calculated from the actor's birth date and the session date.<br>
				When an age can be calculated, it will appear in the output file.<br>
				(Age = Session Date - Actor's Birth Date)</p>

				<h4>Export Actors as JSON</h4>

				<h4>Import actors from JSON or IMDI</h4>
				<p>Please import UTF-8 encoded files only!</p>
